# Machine-Deep-Learning
This repository contains some of my Deep Learning, Machine Learning and data analysis projects.

The **Classification** folder hosts some projects involving the application of machine learning algorithms for classification. For the time being, there is only one jupyter notebook, where I did some exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling of a customer churn dataset.
